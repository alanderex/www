                <p>PYCON.DE is the traditional meeting point for people working
                and playing with Python. Held in Germany and kept in English
                language, it is open to all Python professionals and
                enthusiasts from Central Europe and all over the world. </p>
            </div>
               <p> We expect up to 300 participants on PyCon.DE 2017 Karlsruhe.
               The conference will last 3 days with about 45 talks, tuorials and hands on sessions.
               Python is a programming language that has found application and
               friends in many areas. Due to its popularity in science, Python
               has experienced a meteoric rise in the data science community
               over the past two years. At the conference, we expect a broad
               and interesting mix of software developers with a broad horizon:
               </p>
               <ul>
                   <li>Software Developer</li>
                   <li>Data Scientist</li>
                   <li>System Administrator</li>
                   <li>Academic Scientists</li>
                   <li>Technology Enthusiasts</li>
               </ul>
               <p>The PyCon.DE 2017 will be held at the <a href="#venue">Center for Art and
                   Media</a> in Karlsruhe. Karlsruhe as a city and a decisive IT region
                in the south-west of Germany and the ZKM as a venue represent a
                perfect venue for the PyCon.DE region and region.</p>
                <p>In Germany and across Europe, Karlsruhe occupies top positions in research,
                technology and innovation. The region has a high reputation among universities
                and research institutes. The <a href="http://kit.edu">Karlsruhe Institute of Technology</a> is a nationwide
                unification of the national research center Karlsruhe with the local university
                and sets the standard worldwide. In the city and region around 3,600 IT
                companies with more than 36,000 jobs are located. The industry is integrated
                into the <a href="https://www.cyberforum.de">cyberforum</a> IT company network and has formed a "software cluster",
                which has been awarded and sponsored by the federal government.</p>

                        <p>
                        <a href="https://python.org">Python</a> is a widely
                        used high-level programming language for
                        general-purpose programming, created by Guido van
                        Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted
                        language, Python has a design philosophy which
                        emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace
                        indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly
                        braces or keywords), and a syntax which allows
                        programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code
                        than possible in other languages.

                <blockquote>
                    The ZKM | Center for Art and the Media is a unique cultural institution, as it is a place that extends the original tasks of the museum. It is a home of all media and genres, a house of both the ragmatized arts, painting, photography and sculpture as well as the time-based arts such as film, video, media art, music, dance, theater and performance. As a museum the ZKM was founded in 1989 with the mission to continue the classical arts in the digital age. This is why it is sometimes called the "electronic or digital Bauhaus" - an expression that is traced back to Heinrich Klotz. In addition, the ZKM also accommodates institutes and laboratories in which scientific research, development and production are carried out. In addition to the museum's classical guiding principle, to ensure that works of art do not disappear, the ZKM has also undertaken the task of creating the conditions for the creation of works of art - on the one hand by guest artists and on the other by the employees of the house. This is why it is called the center and not the museum. <a href="http://zkm.de/ueber-uns">#</a>

        <div class="section-heading">
            <h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
        </div>

<p>
Python is a diverse community who maintains a reputation as a friendly, welcoming, inspiring and dynamic group. We’d like to keep it that way, which is why we ask all attendees, organizers and sponsors to follow this code of conduct (CoC).
</p><p>

If you have questions regarding this CoC, please contact the PYCON.DE CoC WG. Your questions will only be seen by the members of the CoC workgroup and treated confidentially.
</p>

<h3>
Be nice to each other
</h3>
<p>
We trust that attendees will treat each other in a way that reflects the widely held view that diversity and friendliness are strengths of our community to be celebrated and fostered.
</p><p>

Furthermore, we believe attendees have a right to:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
be treated with courtesy, dignity and respect;
    </li>
    <li>
be free from any form of discrimination, victimization, harassment or bullying;
    </li>
    <li>
enjoy an environment free from unwelcome behavior, inappropriate language and unsuitable imagery.
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Be professional and don’t spam</h3>
<p>
We consider Python a great setting to showcase the work of the community and would like to encourage networking and business related discussions, as well as keep the conference presentations meaningful and interesting for everyone.
</p>
<p>
We therefore:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>only allow company marketing or recruiting related activities at the conference in accordance with our sponsor agreements;</li>
    <li>request presentations - outside the official recruiting sessions - to focus on Python related topics, not on recruitment.</li>
</ul>


<p>
The PYCON.DE Organizers will be happy to answer any questions related to marketing or recruiting activities.
</p>

<h3>Solving problems</h3>
<p>
If problems covered by this code of conduct arise, please contact one of PYCON.DE CoC contacts listed below or any other PYCON.DE organizer directly and in private. Any complaint will remain confidential, be taken seriously, investigated, and dealt with appropriately.
</p>
<p>
The PYCON.DE organizers reserve the right to carry out any of the following actions relating to a complaint:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
The person concerned may be told to stop/modify his/her behavior appropriately and a warning will be issued.
    </li>
    <li>
The person concerned may be warned that enforcement action may be taken if the behavior continues.
    </li>
    <li>
The person concerned may be asked to leave the venue immediately and/or may be prohibited from continuing to attend EuroPython (without refund).
    </li>
    <li>
The incident may be reported to the local authorities.
    </li>
</ul>
